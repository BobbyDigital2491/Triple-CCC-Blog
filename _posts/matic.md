## What is Polygon?

Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is a decentralized platform that uses Ethereum as its underlying blockchain. Polygon is focused on providing an easy and scalable way for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts on Ethereum.

One of the key features of Polygon is its use of sidechains, which are separate blockchain networks that are connected to the main Ethereum blockchain. This allows for the creation of more efficient and scalable dapps and smart contracts, as they can run on the sidechains without clogging up the main Ethereum network.

Another important aspect of Polygon is its focus on interoperability, which is the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other. Polygon uses a number of different protocols, such as Ethereum's Plasma and the Interledger Protocol, to enable interoperability and allow for the seamless transfer of value between different blockchain networks.

Polygon also has a strong focus on user experience and ease of use. It has a number of developer tools and libraries, such as the Polygon SDK and the Polygon JavaScript library, that make it easy for developers to build and deploy dapps and smart contracts on the platform. This makes Polygon an attractive option for developers who want to build on Ethereum but are looking for a more user-friendly and scalable solution.
