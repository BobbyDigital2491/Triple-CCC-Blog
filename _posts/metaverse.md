The Metaverse is defined by Wikipedia as a collective virtual shared space, created by the bringing together of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet. In the late 70’s and early 80’s many people in the tech industry have imagined a future state of the internet called “the Metaverse”. The Metaverse will potentially change and revolutionize the digital world as well as the physical, all the services and platforms on top of them, how they work and how they buy and sell goods.   
## The Metaverse in Pop Culture

Probably the first to movie to show the metaverse,  “Tron” came out in 1982  and gave an early glimpse into how computers can create a metaverse. It gave an early idea of what an immersive cyberspace could be and what it could mean for human engagement. Other movies like Ready Player One are one of the best and most recent examples of what the Metaverse looks like. Interactive, Immersive, and endless digital world filled with users from all over the real world. The story is based on a book but the film adaptation does a great job of showing the use of personal avatars as symbols of individuality and self expression. It also explores the concept of the digital world affecting the physical world. In the “Ready Player One” metaverse a person can earn income to live off of either in the physical world, the digital world, or a hybrid of the two.
