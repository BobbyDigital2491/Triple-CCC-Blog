The Metaverse is defined by Wikipedia as a collective virtual shared space, created by the bringing together of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet. In the late 70’s and early 80’s many people in the tech industry have imagined a future state of the internet called “the Metaverse”. The Metaverse will potentially change and revolutionize the digital world as well as the physical, all the services and platforms on top of them, how they work and how they buy and sell goods.   

## The Metaverse in Pop Culture

Probably the first to movie to show the metaverse,  “Tron” came out in 1982  and gave an early glimpse into how computers can create a metaverse. It gave an early idea of what an immersive cyberspace could be and what it could mean for human engagement. Other movies like Ready Player One are one of the best and most recent examples of what the Metaverse looks like. Interactive, Immersive, and endless digital world filled with users from all over the real world. The story is based on a book but the film adaptation does a great job of showing the use of personal avatars as symbols of individuality and self expression. It also explores the concept of the digital world affecting the physical world. In the “Ready Player One” metaverse a person can earn income to live off of either in the physical world, the digital world, or a hybrid of the two. 

## The Metaverse and Businesses

One of the main possibilities of the metaverse in business is the ability to create immersive, interactive experiences for customers. For example, a fashion retailer could create a virtual store in the metaverse where customers can try on and interact with virtual clothing, shoes, and accessories in real time. This could provide a more engaging and personalized shopping experience for customers.

Another possibility of the metaverse in business is the ability to host virtual events and conferences. Instead of requiring attendees to travel to a physical location, businesses could host virtual conferences and trade shows in the metaverse, where attendees can interact and participate in real time. This could save businesses and attendees time and money, and reduce the environmental impact of physical events.

Another possibility of the metaverse in business is the ability to create virtual offices and coworking spaces. Instead of requiring employees to physically be in the same location, businesses could create virtual office spaces in the metaverse where employees can collaborate and work together in real time. This could provide businesses with greater flexibility and reduce the need for physical office space.

One of the challenges of using the metaverse in business is the lack of standardization and interoperability. Because the metaverse is still in its early stages, there is currently no standard way to create and access virtual spaces, which can make it difficult for businesses to integrate with the metaverse.

Another challenge is the potential for virtual crimes and cyberbullying. Because the metaverse is a virtual shared space, there is the potential for individuals to engage in criminal activities or bully others in the virtual world. This could create legal and ethical challenges for businesses operating in the metaverse.
