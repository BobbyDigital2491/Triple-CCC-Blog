## Decentralized Autonomous Organization
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members.

Probably the first to movie to show the metaverse,  “Tron” came out in 1982  and gave an early glimpse into how computers can create a metaverse. It gave an early idea of what an immersive cyberspace could be and what it could mean for human engagement. Other movies like Ready Player One are one of the best and most recent examples of what the Metaverse looks like. Interactive, Immersive, and endless digital world filled with users from all over the real world. The story is based on a book but the film adaptation does a great job of showing the use of personal avatars as symbols of individuality and self expression. It also explores the concept of the digital world affecting the physical world. In the “Ready Player One” metaverse a person can earn income to live off of either in the physical world, the digital world, or a hybrid of the two.
