## So what's a NFT?
An NFT stands for a non fungible token. Non Fungible means it is unique and can’t be replaced with something else. It is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos.


## What does fungible mean?

In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable and each of those parts are indistinguishable from another part. For example, gold is fungible since a specified amount of pure gold is equivalent to that same amount of pure gold, whether in the form of coins, ingots, or in other states. Examples of other fungible commodities include crude oil, company shares, bonds, other precious metals, and currencies.
Fungibility refers to the equivalence and indistinguishability of each unit of a commodity with other units of a same commodity, and not to the exchange for one commodity for another. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different.

## NFT Collectables

NFTs  are digital assets that proves you have unique ownership of a unique virtual item such as online pictures and videos, digital art, sports trading cards, etc. Although when it comes to online content such as pictures and videos people may be able to copy an item, ownership of the original is encrypted and cannot be changed unless it is sold and the property is officially transferred to a new owner. Websites such as OpenSea and Rarible act as marketplaces and list the prices. Ownership of NFTs are secured with the same type of encryption technology as Cryptocurrency, with a record stored on the Blockchain. Imagine that you are playing CALL OF DUTY or FORTNITE and you get a ‘Rare Supply Drop”.  These items are actually available to everyone for the same price, so technically they really aren’t that rare. However NFTs make it possible for gamers to have digital property rights.
