## What is Crypto?
A Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual asset that takes the form of "coins" or "tokens", designed to work as a
medium of exchange. Usually, each one of these crypto
tokens has a very different and unique purpose. The main
difference between Crypto and the USD is that the dollar is
tangible whereas Crypto is not. Cryptocurrencies function
as a medium of trade and are almost always designed to
be free from government manipulation and control.

## What is the Blockchain?
The Blockchain is a system of storing and recording information in a way that makes it
difficult or impossible to change, hack or cheat the system. It is a digital
ledger of transactions that is duplicated or distributed across the entire network of
computers on the blockchain. Data is stored in blocks that are chained together.
Hence the name "Blockchain". The goal of Blockchain is to allow digital information to
be stored and recorded but not edited.
