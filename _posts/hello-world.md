Cryptocurrency, also known as crypto, is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any central authority such as a government or financial institution. Crypto is based on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions on multiple computers.
